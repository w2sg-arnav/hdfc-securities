Extract all text content and tabular data from this image, strictly preserving the original reading order as they appear on the page.

1. **Reading Order:** Process the content strictly based on the reading order within the image. Do not rearrange or reorder blocks or tables.

2. **Text Blocks:** Extract distinct blocks of text and represent each block as a separate entity, separated by double newlines ("\\n\\n").

3. **Tables:** Identify any tables present in the image. For each table, output it in a structured, comma-separated format (.csv). Each row of the table should be on a new line, with commas separating column values.
    - Include the header row, if present.
    - Ensure that all columns of each row are comma separated values.

4. **Output Format:**
    - Output text blocks and tables in the order they are read on the page. When a table is encountered while reading the page, output it in CSV format at that point in the output.

5. If there are no text or no tables return empty string.

    If the table contains only one row, then return text of that row separated by comma.
